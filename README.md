## :bulb: Student of physics

<!-- showcase GIF of science animations -->  
:books: Check out the [The Blank Spot newsletter](https://quentinwach.substack.com/) about science history that I am writing. 

:hand: Collaborate with me on the projects directly here on GitHub!
Sometimes, I create [science animations](https://github.com/QuentinWach/Animating-Science) and I am working on related [tutorials](https://quentinwach.github.io/Animating-Science/) as well.

:question: Do you want some good book recommendations or learn how to create animations with Scipy (Python, Matplotlib, Numpy etc.)? Something else?

ðŸ’¬ You can also chat with me on [Twitter @QuentinWach](https://twitter.com/QuentinWach).
