**Hey! ðŸ‘‹**
I am Quentin and I primarily work in areas involving computers, physics, and often both.

Like building _opto-electronic integrated circuits_ for _quantum computers_, for _communication_, or _artificial intelligence_,
developing _design, analysis, and automation tools_, 
writing computer _simulations_ to answer questions in physics,
training _deep neural networks_,
and more, simply trying to make myself useful.
