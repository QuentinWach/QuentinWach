## Physics student in Germany at Technical University Berlin. :bulb: Thinking about intelligence and machine learning.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently learning about **biologically plausible machine learning** :books: also reading and thinking about **neuroscience** and **open science**.

ðŸ‘¯ Collaborate with me on the projects directly here on GitHub!
I currently post animations made with the Scipy stack and am working on tutorials.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about animations with Scipy(Python, Matplotlib, Numpy etc.).
