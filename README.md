**Hey! ðŸ‘‹**
I am Quentin and I am extremely interested in computing, physics, and AI. Among other things, I'm creating _electronic and photonic integrated circuits_ while developing new _design automation_ tools for this process. I hope to release something useful into the wild in 2024. If you are interested in chatting about this, feel free to reach out to me via [X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/QuentinWach), or check out my website [www.quentinwach.com](https://quentinwach.com) which I am currently populating with more information.
