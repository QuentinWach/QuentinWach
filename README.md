## :bulb: Student of physics

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! 

The methods and mechanisms that lead to innovation and the **expansion of knowledge** fascinate me, and I feel obligated, not just to **learn and research** but to **enable others** to do so as well. So for quite some time now, I have become obsessed with **ebooks** and how to revive the market. I love books but I see enormous potential in the digital alternative. :books: Check out my [writing](https://quentinwach.substack.com/) on STEM, academia ðŸŽ“ and scientific publishing ðŸ“‘. 

ðŸ–¥ Currently, I am working on slowly moving from **scientific computing** for **physics** and **machine intelligence** to creating cross plattform applications.
