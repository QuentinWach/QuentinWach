## :bulb: Student of physics

<!-- showcase GIF of science animations -->

Hey there! I have become obsessed with **ebooks** and how to revive the market. I love books but I see enormous potential in the digital alternative. :books: Check out my [writing](https://quentinwach.substack.com/) on STEM, academia and scientific publishing. The methods that lead to innovation and the expanse of knowledge fascinate me, and I feel obligated, not just to learn and research but to enable others to do so as well!

ðŸ–Œ Grown up among artists, I often work as a graphics or web designer. And I love to create [programmtic science animations](https://github.com/QuentinWach/Animating-Science), too.

ðŸ–¥ Yet currently, I am working on slowly moving from **scientific computing** for **physics** and **machine intelligence** to creating cross plattform applications.
