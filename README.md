## :bulb: Animating science & thinking about intelligence and machine learning

<!-- showcase GIF of science animations -->  
<!--:books: I'm learning about **biologically plausible machine learning** right now, also reading and thinking about **neuroscience** and **open science**.-->

:hand: Collaborate with me on the projects directly here on GitHub!
I create [science animations](https://github.com/QuentinWach/Animating-Science) and am working on [tutorials](https://quentinwach.github.io/Animating-Science/).

:question: Ask me about animations with Scipy (Python, Matplotlib, Numpy etc.).
